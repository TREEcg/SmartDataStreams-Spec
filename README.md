# The Smart Data Specification for Semantically Describing Streams

A `sds:Stream` is a stream of objects that have undergone transformations. These transformations are described in RDF.

The objective of a Smart Data Stream is to have a semantically described stream. This information contains the lineage of the stream.

The HTML specification can soon be found here.

This specification uses the [P-Plan specification](http://vocab.linkeddata.es/p-plan/) to describe previous steps taking that result in the current stream.


## Build the spec

Install bikeshed (pip3), then run `bikeshed watch sds.bs`.
